## 📌 Project Overview

**Anonify** is an anonymous messaging platform that empowers users to share messages without revealing their identity—while ensuring safety and responsibility through built-in AI-powered content moderation. It addresses growing concerns around misuse of anonymity on digital platforms by detecting and filtering out inappropriate, offensive, or spammy content before it's delivered to recipients.

The platform utilizes a supervised machine learning approach to identify and block harmful content, making anonymous communication more secure, respectful, and meaningful.
